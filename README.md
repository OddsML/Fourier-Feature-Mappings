# Fourier Feature Mappings
This repo contains a collection of Fourier feature mappings I've reproduced from the paper: _Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains_ (Tancik et al., 2020).

I include brief experiments training image-regression MLPs on a single image (the Mona Lisa). Further details included in the Jupyter Notebook.
